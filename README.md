Wick is an HTML5-based Flash-style editor and player for interactive media on the web.

Try the editor and see the demos [here](http://wickeditor.com/)!

### How to run the editor locally for development
* Clone or download and unzip this repo
* Open terminal in the newly made `wick` folder and start an HTTP server:
  * `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python 2)
  * `python -m http.server` (Python 3)
* OR if you have npm installed, you can get [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server), which is faster
  * `npm install http-server -g` to install
  * `http-server` to start
* Open a browser window, and go to `http://localhost:8000/`
